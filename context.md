## Project Summary

**Overview**  
The Daily Planner is a PHP-based application designed to help users manage daily tasks and categories. It follows an MVC architecture with an object‐oriented design, ensuring clear separation between configuration, business logic, and presentation layers. The application leverages a MySQL database via PDO and implements a singleton pattern for database connections.

**Directory Structure & Key Components**  
- **/config/**  
  - *Database.php*: Implements a singleton pattern for database connection management and handles connection errors.  
  - *Config.php*: Stores application configuration details (e.g., database credentials, environment settings).

- **/src/**  
  - **Controllers/**  
    - *CategoryController.php*: Handles HTTP requests for category CRUD operations, interfacing between models and views.  
    - *TaskController.php*: (Planned) To manage task operations such as creation, updates, deletion, and status management.
    
  - **Models/**  
    - *BaseModel.php*: Provides foundational methods for all models, such as attribute handling and validation routines.  
    - *Category.php*: Manages category-specific data, including validation (like color coding) and relationships to tasks.  
    - *Task.php*: Manages task data with support for recurring tasks and associated validations.
    
  - **Services/**  
    - *CategoryService.php*: Encapsulates business logic related to categories, including validation and data transformation before persistence.  
    - *TaskService.php*: (Planned) To handle business logic for tasks, such as managing task statuses and recurring task details.
    
  - **Repositories/**  
    - *CategoryRepository.php*: Contains methods for executing category-related database queries, ensuring a clear separation from business logic.  
    - *TaskRepository.php*: Provides similar data access methods for task-related operations.

- **/public/**  
  - *index.php*: Serves as the dashboard or main entry point.  
  - *categories.php* and *tasks.php*: Front controllers handling category and task requests, respectively.  
  - **/assets/**: Contains static resources (CSS, JavaScript, images).

- **/views/**  
  - Contains HTML templates for rendering category pages (listing, add, edit) and the main dashboard, which features a quick task creation widget, an overview of today’s tasks, and basic statistics.

**Current Functionality & Future Enhancements**  
- **Implemented Features:**  
  - Secure database interactions via PDO and a singleton connection pattern.  
  - CRUD operations for categories, including color coding and validation.  
  - A dashboard that provides a quick task creation widget, an overview of current tasks, and category statistics.

- **Planned Features:**  
  - Complete task management system with CRUD operations, recurring task handling, status, and priority management.  
  - Extended user interface improvements (AJAX updates, responsive design, advanced search/filtering).  
  - Robust error handling, authentication, and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end).

## Detailed Function Analysis

### Database Layer
- **Database.php:**  
  - Implements a singleton design pattern to ensure a single, shared PDO connection across the application.  
  - Provides secure database connection handling and error management.

- **Config.php:**  
  - Stores all application-wide settings and credentials, centralizing configuration for easier management and security.

### Models
- **BaseModel.php:**  
  - Serves as the base for all models, offering common methods for attribute management, data validation, and database interactions.
  
- **Category.php:**  
  - Inherits from BaseModel.  
  - Manages category-specific data, enforces validation rules (like color code formats), and maintains relationships with tasks.
  
- **Task.php:**  
  - Inherits from BaseModel.  
  - Handles task-specific operations including support for recurring tasks, validations, and state management.

### Controllers
- **CategoryController.php:**  
  - Receives HTTP requests for category operations (e.g., add, edit, delete).  
  - Orchestrates data flow between models and views, ensuring that user actions are correctly processed and validated.
  
- **TaskController.php:**  
  - (Planned) Will process HTTP requests related to tasks, such as creating new tasks, updating existing ones, and managing task statuses.

### Services
- **CategoryService.php:**  
  - Contains business logic for processing category data before it reaches the repository layer.  
  - Handles validation, transformation, and coordination between controllers and repositories.
  
- **TaskService.php:**  
  - (Planned) Will encapsulate the business logic for tasks, ensuring consistency in task processing (e.g., handling recurring tasks and priority management).

### Repositories
- **CategoryRepository.php:**  
  - Directly interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations for categories, abstracting SQL queries from higher-level logic.
  
- **TaskRepository.php:**  
  - Will manage database operations related to tasks, ensuring that task-related data access is efficient and secure.

### Views
- Provide the front-end templates that render the dashboard, category management pages, and task-related interfaces. These include dynamic elements for task creation, editing forms, and status displays.

## Rewriting & Standardization Instructions

1. **Adopt Consistent Naming Conventions**  
   - **Classes:** Use PascalCase (e.g., `TaskController`, `CategoryRepository`).  
   - **Methods:** Use camelCase (e.g., `getTaskList()`, `validateInput()`).  
   - **Files:** Align file names with class names for easier mapping (e.g., `CategoryController.php` should contain the `CategoryController` class).  
   - **Variables:** Use descriptive lowerCamelCase names.

2. **Follow PSR Standards (PSR-1 & PSR-12)**  
   - Maintain standardized coding style, indentation, and formatting.  
   - Use autoloading and namespaces consistently throughout the project.

3. **Improve Code Organization and Separation of Concerns**  
   - Ensure controllers are lean; delegate business logic to service classes.  
   - Keep repository classes focused solely on data access logic.  
   - Modularize code to facilitate easier testing and future scalability.

4. **Enhance Error Handling and Validation**  
   - Implement custom exception classes to standardize error responses.  
   - Use try-catch blocks where appropriate and log errors using a centralized logging mechanism.  
   - Validate inputs rigorously in both controllers and models, providing clear error messages to the user.

5. **Optimize Database Interactions**  
   - Continue using the singleton pattern for the database connection.  
   - Ensure all queries use prepared statements to safeguard against SQL injection.  
   - Consider implementing query optimization techniques where needed.

6. **Refactor Duplicate Code**  
   - Identify and abstract repetitive code segments into reusable helper functions or traits.  
   - Maintain consistency in the implementation of similar functionalities across different modules.

7. **Improve Documentation and Inline Comments**  
   - Add clear docblocks to all classes and methods to explain their purpose and usage.  
   - Use inline comments judiciously to explain complex logic without cluttering the code.

8. **Ensure Scalability and Maintainability**  
   - Structure the codebase to accommodate new features like authentication, UI enhancements, and advanced analytics with minimal refactoring.  
   - Adopt dependency injection where applicable to enhance testability and reduce coupling.

9. **Plan for Future Enhancements**  
   - Leave clearly defined placeholders or interfaces for upcoming features (e.g., Task Instance handling, Authentication System).  
   - Write extensible code that allows for future improvements without significant rewrites.

10. **Adhere to Version Control Best Practices**  
    - Use descriptive commit messages to document changes clearly.  
    - Branch for significant feature updates or refactoring tasks.  
    - Regularly merge and review code to ensure consistency across the project.

By following this detailed summary and the accompanying set of instructions, the codebase can be rewritten to achieve greater standardization, enhanced maintainability, and easier error identification. This approach will also help ensure that the project aligns with best practices and modern PHP development standards.
